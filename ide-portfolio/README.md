Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This project is designed to mimic a **VS Code Environment**, providing an immersive "IDE Illusion" for visitors. It showcases my projects, skills, and background in a format that developers feel right at home with.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **VS Code Theme**: A full dark-mode aesthetic with activity bars, file explorers, and status bars using standard VS Code colors (`#1E1E1E`).
- **Interactive Terminal**: A functioning terminal at the bottom that accepts commands like `help`, `ls`, and `open <file>`.
- **File System Navigation**: Navigate the site by clicking on "files" like `home.tsx`, `about.json`, and `projects.js`.
- **Code Layouts**: Content is presented with line numbers and syntax highlighting to look like real code.
- **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl + K` to open a "Go To File" search modal.
- **Smart Contact Form**: Submitting the contact form mimics sending a network packet in the terminal log.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Features a hamburger menu and drawer navigation for smaller screens.
